# Encoder-Decoder Production

# Note: This code has not been tested lately to make sure it is in full running order. I am working on making sure it is all good. I will delete this note when everything has been set to rights.

In this project I am taking the Frick encoder-decoder tutorial and making changes to
bring it in line with a production-level code repo, which includes doing the following:

1. Using the AI project file structure from this image

2. An external config file

3. Commenting each class/function with a doc string

4. Logging salient parts of the code

5. Comprehensive error handling

6. Including unit tests
